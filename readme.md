# Iteration 3

### How it is going?

Well, the database is connected to the application, and the fun can start now.

### Problems?

A lot of them, starting with dependency inaccuracies, missing beans, but I'm working my way.


# Iteration 1/2

### What is this?

A project for the course Advanced Software Engineering (CS504), written in Spring and Angular

### What is the end project supposed to be like?

Basic bank application, with users, transactions, money accounts and appointment making funcionalities.

### What has been done in this iteration

After two interation the templates for the /home and /signup page have been made, and the hibernate was intergrated into spring.
In the third implementation hopefully we can start working on some logic, considering that we already have the skeleton of the app.
